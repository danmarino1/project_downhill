# Project Downhill

## Description

Project Downhill is a web application that uses North American ski mountains and inputted zip codes to find and compare local resorts for users. The goal of the project is to provide a comprehensive tool for planning ski trips, taking into account the geographical location and preferences of the user.

### What is your project?

The project is a web application built with Python and Streamlit. It uses data from North American ski mountains and user-inputted zip codes to find and compare local resorts. The project was created to help users plan their ski trips more efficiently.

### Usage examples

The main script of the project is `project_downhill.py`, which can be run to start the web application. The script includes data loading, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization of the ski resorts.

### Issues or limitations of the project

As the project is based on specific scenarios and data, it may not be applicable or accurate for all scenarios or datasets. The data was collected from North American ski mountains and any changes to their data could affect the functionality of the project.

### Future features

Future updates may include analysis for different scenarios, additional features, and improvements to the data cleaning and analysis process. I will also be adding international support for mountains and zip codes.

## Technologies

The project is built with Python, and uses the following libraries:

- pandas
- streamlit
- plotly
- numpy
- geopy

These libraries were chosen for their robust data processing, visualization capabilities, and ability to create interactive web applications.

## Details about use

To use the project, clone the repository and run the `project_downhill.py` script. The script will load the data, clean it, perform the analysis, and visualize the results in a Streamlit application.
